    Overlapping struct settings found.

    Move these field related settings:
        goverter:map Inputs Outputs

    from the "Convert" method to a newly created method with this signature:
        func(github.com/jmattheis/goverter/execution.Input) github.com/jmattheis/goverter/execution.Output

    Goverter won't use "Convert" inside the current conversion method
    and therefore the defined field settings would be ignored.
