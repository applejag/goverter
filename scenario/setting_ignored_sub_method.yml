    Overlapping struct settings found.

    Move these field related settings:
        goverter:map FullName Name

    from this method:
        func (github.com/jmattheis/goverter/execution.Converter).Convert(source github.com/jmattheis/goverter/execution.Input) *github.com/jmattheis/goverter/execution.Output

    To a method you have to create with the following signature:
        func(github.com/jmattheis/goverter/execution.Input) github.com/jmattheis/goverter/execution.Output

    Goverter will not use Convert inside the current conversion method, thus, field related settings would be ignored.
